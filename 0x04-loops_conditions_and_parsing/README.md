## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What did I learn from this project:

* How to create SSH keys
* What is the advantage of using  #!/usr/bin/env bash over #!/bin/bash
* How to use while, until and for loops
* How to use if, else, elif and case condition statements
* How to use the cut command
* What are files and other comparison operators, and how to use them

### [0. Create a SSH RSA key pair](./0-RSA_public_key.pub)
* Create a RSA key pair.


### [1. For Holberton School loop](./1-for_holberton_school)
* Write a Bash script that displays Holberton School 10 times. You must use the for loop (while and until are forbidden)


### [2. While Holberton School loop](./2-while_holberton_school)
* Write a Bash script that displays Holberton School 10 times. You must use the while loop (for and until are forbidden)


### [3. Until Holberton School loop](./3-until_holberton_school)
* Write a Bash script that displays Holberton School 10 times. You must use the until loop (for and while are forbidden)


### [4. If 9, say Hi!](./4-if_9_say_hi)
* Write a Bash script that displays Holberton School 10 times, but for the 9th iteration, displays Holberton School and then Hi on a new line. You must use the while loop (for and until are forbidden) You must use the if statement



### [5. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance](./5-4_bad_luck_8_is_your_chance)
* Write a Bash script that loops from 1 to 10 and: displays bad luck for the 4th loop iteration, displays good luck for the 8th loop iteration, displays Holberton School for the other iterations. You must use the while loop (for and until are forbidden). You must use the if, elif and else statements


### [6. Superstitious numbers](./6-superstitious_numbers)
* Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 20 and: displays 4 and then bad luck from China for the 4th loop iteration, displays 9 and then bad luck from Japan for the 9th loop iteration, displays 17 and then bad luck from Italy for the 17th loop iteration.


### [7. Clock](./7-clock)
* Write a Bash script that displays the time for 12 hours and 59 minutes: display hours from 0 to 12, display minutes from 1 to 59


### [8. For ls](./8-for_ls)
* Write a Bash script that displays: The content of the current directory, In a list format, Where only the part of the name after the first dash is displayed (refer to the example).


### [9. To file, or not to file](./9-to_file_or_not_to_file)
* Write a Bash script that gives you information about the holbertonschool file.


### [10. FizzBuzz](./10-fizzbuzz)
* Write a Bash script that displays numbers from 1 to 100.


### [11. Read and cut](./100-read_and_cut)
* help: read. Write a Bash script that displays the content of the file /etc/passwd.


### [12. Tell the story of passwd](./101-tell_the_story_of_passwd)
* The file /etc/passwd has already been covered in a previous project and you should be familiar with it. Today we will make up a story based on it. Write a Bash script that displays the content of the file /etc/passwd, using the while loop + IFS.


### [13. Let's parse Apache logs](./102-lets_parse_apache_logs)
* Apache is among the most popular web servers in the world, serving 50% of all active websites, no doubt that you will have to interact with it within your career. As a Full-Stack Software Engineer, you have to master the art of parsing log files. Today we will do a simple parsing of Apache log access files. Today the Customer Support department reported that a user reported that the site is being “buggy”. Not being a detailed description, you want to have a look at the Apache logs and gather data about the traffic. Write a Bash script that displays the visitor IP along with the HTTP status code from the Apache log file.


### [14. Dig the data](./103-dig_the-data)
* Now that you’ve parsed the Apache log file, let’s sort the data so you can get a better idea of what is going on. Using what you did in the previous exercise, write a Bash script that groups visitors by IP and HTTP status code, and displays this data.
