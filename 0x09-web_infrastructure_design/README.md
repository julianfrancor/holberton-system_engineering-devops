## Learning Objectives:bulb:
What did I learn from this project:

* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

---

### [0. Simple web stack](./0-simple_web_stack)
* A lot of websites are powered by simple web infrastructure, a lot of time it is composed of a single server with a LAMP stack.

* Requirements:

    - You must use:
```
    1 server
    1 web server (Nginx)
    1 application server
    1 application files (your code base)
    1 database (MySQL)
    1 domain name foobar.com configured with a www record that points to your server IP 8.8.8.8```
* You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
* What is a server
* *What is the role of the domain name
* What type of DNS record www is in www.foobar.com
* What is the role of the web server
* What is the role of the application server
* What is the role of the database
* What is the server using to communicate with the computer of the user requesting the website
* You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
 - SPOF
 - Downtime when maintenance needed (like deploying new code web server needs to be restarted)
 - Cannot scale if too much incoming traffic

### [1. Distributed web infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure)
* On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com.

Requirements:
```You must add:
2 servers
1 web server (Nginx)
1 application server
1 load-balancer (HAproxy)
1 set of application files (your code base)
1 database (MySQL) ```
* You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
* For every additional element, why you are adding it
* What distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works
* Is your load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both
* How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works
* What is the difference between the Primary node and the Replica node in regard to the application
* You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
 - Where are SPOF
 - Security issues (no firewall, no HTTPS)
 - No monitoring

### [2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure)
* On a whiteboard, design a three server web infrastructure that hosts the website www.foobar.com, it must be secured, serve encrypted traffic, and be monitored.

Requirements:

```You must add:
3 firewalls
1 SSL certificate to serve www.foobar.com over HTTPS
3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)```

* You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
* For every additional element, why you are adding it
* What are firewalls for
* Why is the traffic served over HTTPS
* What monitoring is used for
* How the monitoring tool is collecting data
* Explain what to do if you want to monitor your web server QPS
* You must be able to explain what the issues are with this infrastructure:
* Why terminating SSL at the load balancer level is an issue
* Why having only one MySQL server capable of accepting writes is an issue
* Why having servers with all the same components (database, web server and application server) might be a problem


### [3. Scale up](./3-scale_up)

Requirements:
* You must add:
 - 1 server
 - 1 load-balancer (HAproxy) configured as cluster with the other one
* Split components (web server, application server, database) with their own server
* You must be able to explain some specifics about this infrastructure:
 - For every additional element, why you are adding it
